# Pewlett-Hackard Retirement Analysis
 Using SQL to help a company prepare for the "silver tsunami" or a large wave of retirement.
 
 ### Overview of the analysis
 In the project I was tasked with creating multiple queries in SQL that would help the Pewlett-Hackard company identify and count the number of employees nearing retirement and their specific job titles, as well as, identify eligible employees that qualify for a retirement mentorship program to better prepare the company for such a large number of retiring employees. 
 ### Results
  Using the SQL quieries I created four tables that revealed important information to the company:
  
 1. The "silver tsunami" is coming soon and it is massive.
  
 2. Senior Staff and Senior Engineers will take the biggest hit from the retirement wave.
  
 3. Only a couple of managers are nearing retirement 
  
 4. A little over 1,500 employees qualify for the mentorship program

 ### Summary
The analysis of the data allows us to answer two important questions.
- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
   
   The company will need to fill the nearly 72,400 open positions left by retiring emplyoees
   
- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
    
    Based on the current calculation there doesn't seem to be enough elegible employees to run the mentorship program. The roughly 1,500 eligible employees will struggle to manage such a large wave of retirement.
